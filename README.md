# What is this?
A client with an atypical career asked me to build a website for them. Starting with a basic template (Asymmetry from GetTemplates.co), I added a cool feature to allow some discrimination between the types of activity they wanted to highlight.  

# Some cool features
- selecting a topic of interest highlights some of the expansion boxes.
- expansion boxes allow more details to be added than would fit in a 'headline'.
